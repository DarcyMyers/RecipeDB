# RecipeDB

### Django Web App for a Recipe DB
This is a basic Django project (Django 1.8), that I created to keep my Django skills up to date and use as a code sample. 

### Features that still need to be implemented:
- Form validation and tests
- Search engine capabilities for looking up recipes based on a set of ingredients
- Links to nutritional information
- Statistics on nutrition and recipe usage
- inline addition of new ingredients when adding or editing a recipe
- recipe image upload
